## Inheritance-coupling
Exploring inheritance possibilities of ViewController and Nibs

This project demonstrate how it is possible to inherit both functionality and view elements 
in ViewControllers.

This project include:
* 2 ViewControllers ```FirstVC, SecondVC```
* Have common super class called ```ViewControllerBase```
*  ```SecondVC``` has no code and he only retain functionality from base


For testing purposes, I've added some basic functionality in baseViewController and in each other child VC.
* Mixing old autoresize with autolayout in StoryBoard
